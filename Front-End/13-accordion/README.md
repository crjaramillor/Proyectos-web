# Accordion Component

## Overview

This project involves creating an accordion component that displays a list of questions or headings. When a user clicks on a question, its corresponding answer or content section will expand, while collapsing any previously opened section. This ensures that only one section is open at a time, maintaining a clean and organized user interface.

The project is designed to help you practice DOM manipulation, event handling, and implementing responsive design patterns using JavaScript.

## Features

- **Single Section Expansion**: Only one section can be open at a time. Clicking on a question expands its content while collapsing any other open sections.
- **Clean UI**: Keeps the interface organized by showing only one section's content at a time.
- **Responsive Design**: Ensures that the accordion component is usable and looks good on various screen sizes.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML/CSS**: For structuring and styling the accordion component.
- **JavaScript**: For implementing DOM manipulation and event handling.

Feel free to adjust the sections according to your specific needs or preferences!

Happy Coding!
